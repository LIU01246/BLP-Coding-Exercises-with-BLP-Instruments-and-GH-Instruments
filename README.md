# BLP-Exercises-with-BLP-Instruments-and-GH-Instruments

This repository contains Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes (BLP) exercises conducted in BLP (1995) including the logit model (a naive model of demand without the interaction between individual and product characteristics) and the model with interaction without and with BLP instruments. 

Additionally, where I use BLP instruments I add Gandhi-Houde (GH) instruments that were introduced in Gandhi \& Houde (2020) and compare the results.

Please note that this notebook only has codes that are intuitive to understand, but do not perform very fast in terms of computational perspective. I'm working on a JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation in Python, which I expect will perform better.
